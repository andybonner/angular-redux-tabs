<!-- tab-holder will contain both tabs row (ngFor) and tab-content area.
tabs will have (click) method which dispatches select() action.
We'll need an Observable on tab-content so it can display content.
Empty divs will be "invisible" if there's minimal styling, but if there's padding, background-color, box shadow, or border,
they'll be visible. I guess we'll need ngIfs. -->

<p>Tab holder here!</p>
